# Mobile Application to Remind User to Take Essentials
This project is a mobile app that reminds users (primarily the older demographic) to remember to take essentials like keys when they exit the home. The motivation for this project is when I noticed my grandparents commonly forget these essentials when leaving the home, so I thought a simple app like this would significantly make their lives more convenient. This project uses Dart and Flutter SDK.
